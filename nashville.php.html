<p style="text-align: justify;">DEBS 2009 will be held in Nashville, Tennessee during the first week of July.  Nashville is the capital of the U.S. state of Tennessee and is located on the Cumberland River in the north-central part of the state.  Nashville is a major hub for the health care, music, publishing, and transportation industries.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nashville is home to seventeen post-secondary educational institutions, including Vanderbilt University<www.vanderbilt.edu>, founded in 1873, which is Nashville's largest university, enrolling over 11,000 students and containing the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) <www.isis.vanderbilt.edu>, which is one of
the largest R&D organizations in the USA focusing on model-driven technologies.  Nearby, a full-scale replica of the Athenian Parthenon <www.nashville.gov/parthenon> has stood in since 1897 and is in much better condition than the original ;-).  Examples of classical and neoclassical architecture can be found throughout the city.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many activities for visitors available in Nashville, as described at www.onlinenashvilleguide.com.  Many popular tourist sites in Nashville involve live and recorded music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame 
  <www.countrymusichalloffame.com> and Ryman Auditorium <www.ryman.com>, which was for many years the site of the famous "Grand Ole Opry" <www.opry.com> that's now located near the airport.  Downtown Nashville is home to a large number of music clubs and honky tonks, including the infamous Tootsie's Orchid Lounge<www.tootsies.net>, which hosted many big names from the country music scene whilst remaining small, intimate, and unchanged since it started in the sixties.  The Wildhorse Saloon <www.wildhorsesaloon.com> is another great spot if you enjoy country dancing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additional sites of interest include Cheekwood <www.cheekwood.org>, home of the Maxwell House coffee fortune or the Hermitage<www.hermitage.org/indexHome.htm>, home of Andrew Jackson, 7th president of the USA.  If you are interested in a unique Nashville experience, make a reservation at the Bluebird Caf&eacute; <www.bluebirdcafe.com> for an evening of authentic songwriting and performing like you've never experienced before (ssshh &ndash; No talking!!).  For a truly renaissance experience, consider an afternoon tea at the Hermitage Hotel <www.thehermitagehotel.com/index.cfm?obj=theHotel>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 20px;">The average temperature in early July is the mid-80's Fahrenheit, which is around 29 Celsius.  The airport is close by (i.e., 15-20 minutes) to the city and to Vanderbilt University, so getting to the conference facilities will be straightforward.
