	<h1>DEBS 2009</h1>
	<h4>3nd International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems</h4>
	
	<h5>Call for Fast Abstracts, Posters, and Demos</h5>
</div>

<p><b>Fast Abstracts</b> are short presentations, either on new ideas or work in
progress, or radical opinions that can address any issue relevant to
event-based systems and complex event processing. Fast Abstracts provide an
opportunity to receive early feedback from the community. Contributions are
particularly solicited from industrial practitioners and academics that may
not have been able to prepare full papers, but seek an opportunity to
engage with the DEBS community. Accepted contributions will be published in
electronic form, and an author will deliver a short talk in the Fast
Abstracts track at the conference.</o>

<p><b>Demo papers</b> report on an existing research prototype by clearly identifying
the original contributions and ideas demonstrated. The authors are expected
to prepare a poster and perform a live software demonstration on their own
laptop during an exhibit-style conference reception. Any special
requirements should be identified in the appendix of the paper. Accepted
contributions will be published in electronic form.</p>

<p><b>Poster papers</b> report on an existing research project by clearly identifying
